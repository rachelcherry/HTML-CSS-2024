 <p>This is a page about myself and the project I am doing. I am currently taking CS 391 where I am learning how to create websites!

 My name is Rachel Cherry, and I am a junior at Boston University studying Computer Science.  I am originally from Baltimore, Maryland. In my free time, I like to workout and play with my two dogs!</p>
